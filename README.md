# Minecraft-Time Clock (Action Bar)
Converts the ticks of the in-game "daytime" number into the hh:mm:ss format, though the seconds are optional and it is possible to switch between the 12-hour time convention or the 24-hour time convention. By default the seconds are turned off and it is in the 12-hour time convention. You must hold a clock in the off-hand or in the mainhand (the selected hotbar slot) in order to see the formatted clock.

# Minecraft-Time Clock (Action Bar)
Converts the ticks of the in-game "daytime" number into the hh:mm:ss format, though the seconds are optional and it is possible to switch between the 12-hour time convention and the 24-hour time convention. By default the seconds are turned off and it is in the 12-hour time convention. You must hold a clock in the off-hand or in the mainhand (the selected hotbar slot) in order to see the formatted clock. 

You use these commands to change the two options:
* Use this command to turn off or turn on the seconds in the clock (seconds are off by default): `/trigger seconds`
* Use this command to switch between the 12-hour time convention and the 24-hour time convention (set to 12-hour time by default): `/trigger timeconvention`
